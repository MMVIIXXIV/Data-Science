### Data-Science
data-science course


-Most of the case, I'm using colab which is a free lab provided by google. It is very easy to use and you don't need to download any libary.
-However, if you are using jupiter notebook, you might need to download libaries first.
-I have provided the data to test in ".csv" file format. you just need to change the path location in 
-[pd.read_csv(r'/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/DATA SCIENCE/W2 - Data Sets/netflix_data.csv')]
-to 
-[ pd.read_csv(r'/your_csv_file_path')]
-I also added some comment explaining what the code do.
